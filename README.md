# Bad Banana React App

Final Project: MERN Stack Single-Page Application

## User story 

- As developers we want to create a MERN Stack Single-Page Application app application that to allow users to search, save and rate movies
- AS developers we want an application that allows users to login in and sign up to the website and have access to their saved movies, and ratings on movies as well as to search new movies

## Description

This a single page mern applictaion that is developed for a movie data base called bad banana wherebye a user can access. Taking pre-existing code for a book search application and refactoring the code to take the database from using RESTful APIs to using a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. This application is built using the MERN stack, which includes the following frameworks, MongoDB, Express.js, React and Node.js.


## User Story


* AS AN avid movie watcher
* I WANT to search for movies and ratings
* SO THAT I can pick the best movies to watch, save and rate



## Acceptance Criteria

Use React for the front end.

Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.

Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.

Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.

Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

Have a polished UI.

Be responsive.

Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

Include authentication (JWT).

Protect sensitive API key information on the server.

Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, etc.).

Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).






Challenges in this project: biggest challenge with this project, was getting restful apis to link to the application with no error to allow for successful movie rating to show, find where to watch movies and to find movies searched. Another issue came from merging the backend and frontend together using a third party api being tail wind with so many conflicts as a team we worked together to rebuild the fornt end onto the back end using bootstrap which was a success


## Installation

Start by downloading the code from the repository, then load in VS code, open a terminal and make sure you are in the project folder.
Initialise the code by typing into the terminal:
```bash
npm i
```

## Using the code

To initialise the code you will need to run the following commands in the terminal to run up the program:

- To get the code running locally in development mode you will need to enter into the terminal:
```bash
npm run develop
```
and go to

```bash
localhost:3000
```

Once you have finished using the code, be sure to run *(ctrl+C)* or *(^C)* to close down the session.

The code files are fully commented, to explain the flow and logic of the code, so that others can work on this and expand on it too.
